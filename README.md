### Author's notes

Bookmarks and feeds naturally get along, so it was obvious to me to manage them
from the same application.

The intent behind Cyca is to put light on feeds you can miss: as Cyca can
discover feeds in your bookmarks, when you bookmark a URL, you automatically
gain visibility to declared feeds. You don't even need to know about RSS or Atom
at all, which could introduce new people to these technologies.
